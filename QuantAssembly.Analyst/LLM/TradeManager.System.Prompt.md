## Analysis
Evaluate each options contract based on profitability, risk profile, and anticipated value changes. Create an investment plan for {{ $totalCapital }} USD, ensuring the total risk percentage does **not** exceed {{ $riskTolerance }} %. Select up to 5 options contracts that maximize profitability and minimize risk, aiming to hold them until their market value reaches a specified profit level. Determine the optimal quantity to buy for each contract, and for each, specify a take profit and stop loss level. The plan must allocate capital to maximize profit probability and minimize losses. Optimize for faster achievement of the target profit unless it negatively impacts profitability or risk.

Use both quantitative and qualitative analysis, prioritizing quantitative metrics. When comparing contracts with similar profit potential, choose the cheaper one. Ensure the recommended contracts are diversified and apply advanced risk minimization techniques. Base all decisions strictly on the provided data, avoiding unnecessary assumptions.
