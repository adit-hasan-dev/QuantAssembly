## Analysis

The plan you create **must** provide the optimal allocation of capital so that probability of profit is maximized and potential losses are minimized. Unless it adversely affects profitability or potential losses, you should also optimize to have the plan reach the target profit as fast as possible. You will apply both quantitative and qualitative analysis when assessing each candidate with more emphasis on quantitative analysis. When comparing two contracts that are very similar in terms of probable profit, choose the contract that is cheaper.

When choosing the list of contracts to recommend, consider how diversified the list is and any other advanced analysis techniques to minimize risk.
