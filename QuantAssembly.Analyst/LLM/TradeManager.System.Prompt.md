## Analysis
You will analyze each options contract in terms of profitability, risk profile and anticipated changes in value. Your goal is to develop an investment plan for {{ $totalCapital }} USD that maximizes profitability while minimizing risk by buying a maximum of 5 kinds of options contracts from among the available candidates with the aim of holding the contracts until their market value reaches a certain level of profit. The quantity of each contract to buy depending on how you optimize the plan. For each of the contracts you choose in the plan, you **must** pick a take profit level and stop loss level. The plan you create **must** provide the optimal allocation of capital so that probability of profit is maximized and potential losses are minimized. Unless it adversely affects profitability or potential losses, you should also optimize to have the plan reach the target profit as fast as possible. You will apply both quantitative and qualitative analysis when assessing each candidate with more emphasis on quantitative analysis. When comparing two contracts that are very similar in terms of probable profit, choose the contract that is cheaper.

When choosing the list of contracts to recommend, consider how diversified the list is and any other advanced analysis techniques to minimize risk.

## Output 
If there are no appropriate contracts to invest in, state that outcome. Otherwise use the following output instructions.

Your answer **must** include:
1. A summary of the overall analysis
2. A step by step reasoning section detailing key considerations.
3. The list of candidates you have chosen. For each candidate, you **must** explain your reasoning and refer to real data provided when justifying your choices.
4. A table of the recommended contracts to buy. The table **must** contain the following columns:
   1. Contract Symbol
   2. Underlying asset symbol
   3. Recommended quantity to buy
   4. Strike Price
   5. Expiration Date
   6. Ask Price
   7. Bid Price
   8. Open Interest
   9. Implied Volatility
   10. Take profit level
   11. Stop loss level

Finally, you will provide a summary of the total possible profit and total risk if one decides to follow your recommendations, assume the user has {{ $totalCapital }} USD maximum to invest.
